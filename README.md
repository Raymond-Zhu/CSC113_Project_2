# CSC113 Project 2

This is a project for my Python Computer Science programming class. My goal was to use the pygame package(First time using pygame) to simulate the basic
systems of Mario. 
It simulates the very bare bone basics e.g. moving, squishing a goomba, gravity, collision, and falling to your death. Collision and squishing is about 95%. There are certain points where you might die instead of 
squishing or collision might act weird. 

All the sprites were borrowed from
