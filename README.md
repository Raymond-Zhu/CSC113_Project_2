# CSC113 Project 2

This is a project for my Python Computer Science programming class. My goal was to use the pygame package to simulate the basic
systems of Mario. 
It simulates the very bare bone basics like moving, squishing a goomba, gravity, collision, and falling to your death. Not the
cleanest code I have ever wrote. Collision and squishing is about 95%. There are certain points where you might die instead of 
squishing or collision might act weird.  Excuse the terrible commits. I sometimes work on too many things at once or I just forget to commit. 

All the sprites were borrowed from
